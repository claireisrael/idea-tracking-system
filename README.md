# Idea Tracker - Next.js & Appwrite Application

## Project Overview

I developed an **Idea Management System** using **Next.js** and **Appwrite** as the backend service. This application allows users to create, manage, and track their ideas with a modern, responsive interface.

## What I Built

### **Core Features**

1. **User Authentication** - Complete auth flow using Appwrite's client-side SDK (`src/lib/appwrite.js`)
2. **Idea Management** - CRUD operations with real-time updates (`src/lib/ideas.js`)
3. **File Storage** - Upload, preview, download attachments (`src/lib/storage.js`)

### **Technical Architecture**

- **Next.js App Router** - File-based routing and component organization
- **Client-Side Integration** - Direct browser-to-Appwrite communication
- **Appwrite SDK** - Database, Storage, and Account services
- **React Hooks** - State management and component lifecycle


### **Architectural Decision**

I chose a **simplified lib/ structure** (instead of separate `config/` and `utils/` folders) to focus on learning Appwrite client-side integration patterns without over-engineering this learning project.

### **Key Features**

- Complete authentication system with session management
- Full CRUD operations for ideas with search/filtering
- File upload/download with progress tracking

## Learning Outcomes

- **Next.js App Router** - Proper file-based routing and component organization
- **Client-Side Integration** - Direct browser-to-backend communication patterns
- **Appwrite Mastery** - Client-side SDK implementation without server complexity

## Thank u Derrick!

Thank you for the **ample time and guidance** throughout this learning journey. Your mentorship helped me develop a solid foundation in modern web development rather than approaching projects with a green mindset.
